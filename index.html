        <p>
          Welcome! I’m Hazal, the founder of Hazal’s Nanny Service — a London-based childcare
          and education company providing trusted support to families for over a decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          With more than 10 years of experience as a nanny, tutor, and nursery teacher,
          I specialise in providing high-quality care and personalised educational support
          to children of all ages, including those with special educational needs (SEN).
        </p>
        <p>
          My background includes a university degree in Philosophy, pedagogical training,
          and up-to-date certifications in safeguarding, paediatric first aid, and food hygiene.
          I also hold a valid DBS check.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hazal’s Nanny Service, my mission is to offer a warm, safe, and enriching environment
          where children can thrive emotionally, socially, and academically. Whether you’re looking
          for full-time care, part-time nanny support, tutoring in core subjects,
          or SEN-focused assistance — I am here to support your family with care, professionalism, and heart.
        </p>

              “We had first session with Hazal today with our daughter.
              Within 2 minutes Keira was totally comfortable with Hazal.
              Hazal is very energetic, gentle and kind person. My daughter
              thoroughly enjoyed her time with her.”

              almost a month. She is very smart, perfectly reliable and
              always punctual. She has a can do attitude. She is very
              positive and energetic. My 2 year old daughter adores her. I
              also believe her being a nursery teacher is a great asset for
              families who would hire her. She can teach a lot to a kid even
              when they are playing together. I would recommend Hazal to any
              family without a single doubt.”

              language, vocabulary and general development have been praised
              by all. She has endless energy and is happy whether stuck
              indoors on a wet day or hitting the park in the sunshine. Her
              list of craft activities and games is endless and she shows

              Marbles are as popular now as they ever were! Why not upcycle
              some of your old cardboard and create a fun marble puzzle for
              the little ones. Cardboard Labrinth Game is great fun for
              slightly older kids. You can adjust your maze to suit the age
              of the child too. Small children might want to roll the
              marbles around using loo rolls. Remember always to supervise
              when playing with marbles.

              Children are fascinated by colour, and this simple activity
              can be easily set up without needing any special supplies.
              Simply grab some coloured paper, scissors and PVA glue. You
              could also use old magazines and cut them up into lots of
              different pieces (the kids can help with that bit too), then
              use them to build up mosaic art!
