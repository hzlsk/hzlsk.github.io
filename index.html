        <p>
          Mrs Asik possesses the most convenient type of educational
          background, qualifications, professional career and personal
          character for the business she intends to start-up in the UK. She
          has been operating in the education sector for many years and she
          has an excellent endowment of being able to communicate with young
          people and children in a marvellous manner. As a counsellor
          teacher, she has taken care of many young students during her
          career at various institutions throughout years and she has
          contributed to the well-being of many students and other children
          in need in a way that has enhanced their learning processes and
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrs Asik has graduated from the department of Philosophy at
          Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey in 2015. During her
          bachelor’s degree studies, she improved her knowledge and skills
          on many areas and forged for a unique set of qualifications
          throughout the years. She took very efficient steps and attended
          many training programs during her studies to develop a successful
          career in the field of education of young people and children in
          need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 09.2014 and 06.2015, she took Pedagogical Training Program
          at her own university, Anadolu University and gained the
          Paediatric Certificate. She then successfully completed
          occupational trainings on Teaching Practice, Special Teaching
          Methods, Instructional Technology and Material Design, Educational
          Psychology, and Educational Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Spring of 2017, she began teaching as a philosophy teacher
          at Sinav Education College at Ankara, Turkey, where she attended
          Counsellor Workshop and completed her training which granted her
          the title of counsellor teacher as well. While working there for
          one academic year, she also attended another workshop and
          completed her Guidance Certificate Program in 2018. Later on, she
          completed Participation in Education Program at Istanbul Gelisim
          University at Ankara, Turkey, whereby she got training on the
          topic of Communication Disorder with Children and Teenagers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been interested in care for students and children with
          special needs, she decided to improve her knowledge on this field
          further and enrolled in Turkish Sign Language Training course in
          Ankara in 2019. Beginning with the Summer Term of 2019, she
          started to work at Toprak Private Education Course in Ankara,
          Turkey and since then, she has been teaching as a counsellor and
          philosophy teacher there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her experience as a counsellor teacher has so far turned out to be
          what she has desired to have for her career. During the time
          being, she has had the chance to take care and deal with so many
          young students and children in need and spared a substantial
          amount of time for them with a unique sense of self-devotion.
          Dedicated to breathing the same environment with children and 3
          young students all the time, she has found the happiness and
          tranquillity in being with them and making them happy. She pretty
          much enjoyed spending her time with them and has always been the
          favourite teacher of theirs as a sincere and cordial counsellor
          educator.
        </p>
        <p>
          She invested a considerable portion of her time to specialize on
          the students and young children with special needs and mastered
          her skills accordingly via different training programs and
          workshops. While developing a career in the education sector as a
          philosophy teacher, she also chose a path to become a counsellor
          teacher where she managed to take care of children and young
          students more closely and deal with their problems and issues in a
          more convenient and instructive way. Besides, she gave private
          tutoring lessons to a lot of students and children with special
          needs such as children with dyslexia and autism and other
          disabilities. She contributed to the well-being and the learning
          processes of the children effectively and she became a high in
          demand teacher in the eyes of many families in need those kinds of
          services.

              Hazal is very energetic, gentle and kind person. My daughter

              almost a month. She is very smart, perfectly reliable and
              always punctual. She has a can do attitude. She is very
              positive and energetic. My 2 year old daughter adores her. I
              also believe her being a nursery teacher is a great asset for
              families who would hire her. She can teach a lot to a kid even
              when they are playing together. I would recommend Hazal to any
              family without a single doubt.”

              Want to start your next art project but worried you don't have
              any craft supplies in the house? We've got the perfect
              activity for you! All you need to make your own salt dough is
              flour, salt and water. You can even decorate your creations
              with food colouring, paints or pens. If you don't have these
              supplies the kids will still love mixing and rolling the
              dough...

              This lovely project combines two fun activities, painting and
              planting. Grab your paints, a terracotta plant pot and get
              cracking on this art project! There isn't much more to it. If
              you want the painting to last though, add a layer of
              waterproof varnish once the paint is dry. Once finished, plant
              your little one's favourite flower!

              One of the simplest ideas in this round-up to make as all you
              need is some paper to get going. If you have older children
              who want a challenge try this How to make an Origami Lion. For
              younger children, you can't beat the fun of a simple origami
              hat.

            <p class="card-text">
              Marbles are as popular now as they ever were! Why not upcycle
              some of your old cardboard and create a fun marble puzzle for
              the little ones. Cardboard Labrinth Game is great fun for
              slightly older kids. You can adjust your maze to suit the age
              of the child too. Small children might want to roll the
              marbles around using loo rolls. Remember always to supervise
              when playing with marbles.

              Children are fascinated by colour, and this simple activity
              can be easily set up without needing any special supplies.
              Simply grab some coloured paper, scissors and PVA glue. You
              could also use old magazines and cut them up into lots of
              different pieces (the kids can help with that bit too), then
              use them to build up mosaic art!

              of dinosaur toys and make your own fossils. Don't have any
              dinosaur toys? See what other household items you can push
              into the clay to look like dinosaur claws! Or adapt to suit
